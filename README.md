# Countries_of_the_World_SQL_Project
Analyzed the 'Countries of the World' dataset using SQL to explore global metrics such as population, GDP, and life expectancy. Identified key trends, such as economic disparities and correlations between GDP and life expectancy. The project provided insights into population distribution and economic factors across countries.
Objective
The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive data analysis on the 'Countries of the World' dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends about various global metrics. The analysis aimed to provide a detailed understanding of country-specific attributes such as population, area, GDP, and other socio-economic indicators.

Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle
Dataset Name: 'Countries of the World'
Description: The dataset contains information about countries around the world, including various indicators such as population, area, GDP, and other economic and demographic statistics.
Key Data Columns
Country: Name of the country.
Population: Total population of the country.
Area (sq. km): Total land area of the country in square kilometers.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product in USD.
Continent: Continent where the country is located.
Language: Primary language spoken in the country.
Region: Geographic or political region of the country.
Life Expectancy: Average life expectancy of citizens.
Methodology
Data Import and Cleaning:

Imported the dataset into a SQL database.
Performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed basic statistics of the dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
Conducted exploratory queries to understand data distributions and identify any anomalies.
SQL Queries and Analysis:

Population Analysis: Identified the top 10 most populous countries and analyzed population density.
Area Analysis: Compared the land area of countries within different continents.
GDP Analysis: Evaluated GDP figures to determine the top economies and analyzed GDP per capita.
Life Expectancy: Investigated the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
Advanced SQL Techniques:

Utilized SQL JOINs to merge data with external datasets if applicable.
Applied SQL functions and aggregations to summarize data and perform complex queries.
Created views and temporary tables for efficient querying and reporting.
Visualization and Reporting:

Created SQL-based reports and visualizations to present findings (e.g., using SQL-based tools or exporting data for use in external visualization tools).
Key Findings
Population Insights: The most populous countries were identified, with a notable concentration of high populations in certain regions.
Economic Disparities: Significant differences in GDP and GDP per capita were observed between continents and regions.
Geographic Patterns: There was a correlation between land area and economic indicators, with larger countries often having higher GDPs.
Life Expectancy Trends: Higher GDP countries generally exhibited higher life expectancy, highlighting the link between economic prosperity and quality of life.
Conclusions
The analysis provided valuable insights into global trends and disparities among countries. It revealed patterns in population distribution, economic strength, and socio-economic development. The findings underscore the impact of economic factors on life expectancy and highlight significant geographical variations.
